This is the MIPS-I ArchC functional model.

This model has the system call emulation functions implemented,
so it is a good idea to turn on the ABI option.

To use acsim, the interpreted simulator:

    acsim mips1.ac -abi -dy             (create the simulator)
    make -f Makefile.archc              (compile)
    mips1.x --load=<file-path> [args]   (run an application)

To use accsim, the compiled simulator:

    accsim mips1.ac -abi -dy <file-path> (create specialized simulator)
    make -f Makefile.archc               (compile)
    mips1.x [args]                       (run the application)

The [args] are optional arguments for the application.

There are two formats recognized for application <file-path>:
- ELF binary matching ArchC specifications
- hexadecimal text file for ArchC


To use acasm, the assembler generator:

    asmgen.sh mips1.ac <assembler_name> (generate the assembler 
                                         source files) 
    proceed to build it using the GNU autotools (configure, make all-gas, 
                                                 make install-gas)

CHANGELOG:
==========
Version 0.7.5

- Added 'bgtu' pseudo-insn
- Added alternative assembly syntaxes to the lwl and lwr instructions
- Fixed the operand encoding of the nop 'instruction'


Version 0.7.4:

- Included assembly language syntax information


Version 0.7.3:

- Use ArchC support for debug messages: ac_debug_model.H
- Use operator[] syntax to read register banks, which is faster


Version 0.7.2:

- Included optimization instruction methods for compiled simulation
- Separate nop instruction from sll to optimize simulation


Version 0.7.1:

- Included file for GDB integration


Version 0.7.0:

- Model passed selected Mediabench and Mibench applications
